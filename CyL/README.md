Cifras y Letras
===============

CyL is a spanish TV contest, that consists of two kinds of games. In one of them, concursantsare given 9 letters, and they have to find words with them that exists in a spanish dictionary.

This is a quite simple algorithm to program, and so I have created this exercise: write a program that reads a words dictionary (the spelling dictionary of LibreOffice, that has a very simple plain text format), asks the user a list of letters and make with them all possible words that exist in the dictionary.

First, I wrote a quick and dirty version of the program, in Python, to be able to compare, and then I wrote again other version, by following the OOP principles of Clean Code and SOLID. Finally, I like to write the program in other languages and paradigms (and to invite other people to do it), to compare them, too.

I find that the the q&d version is shorter and more compact, but however is more difficult to understand. It halso has a bug that is complex to solve without rewriting a big part of the program. The principled version is quite more clear, and when i found the bug i was able to fix it quickly, changing only the affected part.
